<!-- Congrats, you've taken the first step in submitting your first
homework assignment.  This is an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) template,
you can refer back to it any time you are having trouble understanding how your
work needs to be submitted.

If you are able to read this it is because you are reading this html document
in your TEXT EDITOR.  If you were to load this in a web browser, it would work
but you would only see the FRONTEND, whereas the complete markup can be viewed
here in the BACKEND.

Everything in HTML is arranged with TAGS, typically opening tags and closing
tags.  I'm able to type all of this to you in the backend by using the HTML
comment tag (thats the less-than-sign plus the exclamation point followed by
two dashes).  I will close this comment section like so... -->

<!-- Opening it back up again!  Feel free to try this in your own HTML document.
Just go to the top of your text editor and go to FILE, then NEW FILE.  As soon
as your new file opens go up to FILE then SAVE, then give come up with a title
(one word is a best practice).  After you've written your title, BEFORE YOU HIT
ENTER, make sure you follow your title with the EXTENSION .html.  Now you can
start experimenting. -->

<!-- All of your pages should start out by declaring the document type, though
this will not always affect functionality, and if you using HTML in something
like a blog editor, this may not be necessary. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The html tag comes first after the doctype, you won't close this tag until
you are finished.  Don't believe me?  Scroll down to the end.  All closing tags
are delineated by the forward-slash symbol. -->

<html>

<!-- In the head of your document you can link your HTML page to things like
javascript libraries and CSS stylesheets, we'll talk about that later.  For
now just notice that the title goes here.  The title will show up in your web
browser tab in most cases. -->

  <title>Homework One</title>
</head>

<!-- The body is where the bulk of your html is going to go.  Things like
paragraphs, pictures, sounds, and video... for this homework all you
have to do is create a second header tag and a second paragraph tag
giving me a response to the question pose within the paragraph tags I
constructed. -->

<body>
  <!--One header tag coming up! -->
  <h1>
    Question:
  </h1>
  <!--Ooooh, time for a paragraph tag -->
  <p>
    Which of the software packages demoed in class appeals to you the most, and
    why?
  </p>
  <h2>
    Answer:
  </h2>
  <p>
    The software that appeals the most to me is Gimp because it is the one I would use the most as of right now.
    My favorite aspect of Gimp is its versatility. From creating banners for a website to retouching photos 
    there are so many things you can do.
    I am not familiar with the other softwares, but I'm excited about learning how to use them.
  </p>

<!-- Now you:  Create an opening header tag and write the word "Answer" then
create a closing tag.  Now create an opening paragraph tag, and give me an
answer to my question in at least 3 or 4 sentences. -->

<!-- That's it!  That wasn't so hard, was it? -->
